Conquering Self-Doubt & Becoming Your Best Critic
If there’s one person who will always be hardest on you, it’s you. No matter how much you learn, how many projects you build, how much effort you put in—your brain will still whisper, But is it really good enough?

Self-doubt doesn’t just disappear with time. It sticks around. It sneaks in when you least expect it. It tells you that your code, your progress, your skills—they're inadequate.

But here’s the thing: Perfection is a lie. Growth is what matters. Every mistake, every messy project, every failed attempt—it’s proof that you're trying. That you're improving. That you’re learning exactly what you need to learn to get better.

Instead of tearing yourself down when things don’t go perfectly, ask yourself: "What did I learn from this?" "How can I improve?" "What small step can I take today?"

You are always more capable than your doubts make you believe. And the best way to fight them? Keep proving them wrong.
