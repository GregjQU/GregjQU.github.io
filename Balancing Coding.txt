Balancing Coding & Mental Health: You’re Not a Machine
It’s easy to fall into the trap of non-stop hustle. You feel the pressure—learning, grinding, applying for jobs, building projects. And eventually, it stops feeling fulfilling. It starts feeling like survival.

But here’s the truth: you are not a machine. You cannot run on endless lines of code and job applications without breaking down. If you don’t take care of yourself, burnout will do it for you—and trust me, burnout doesn’t care about your deadlines.

Here’s what you need to remember:

Set boundaries. You are allowed to stop working. To close your laptop. To take a breath. Productivity does not define your worth.

Stay connected. Coding can be isolating, but you still need people. Even a small conversation can remind you that you exist beyond your work.

Let yourself rest. You do not have to earn rest. You deserve it—period.

At the end of the day, success isn’t just about landing a job or mastering a programming language. It’s about still being here to enjoy life—to have friendships, to find purpose, to feel okay.

You matter outside of what you create. Don’t let the grind make you forget that.
