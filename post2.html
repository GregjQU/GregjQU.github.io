        <p>Here are some of my favorite coding challenges that helped me improve my skills and learn new concepts...</p>
        <!-- Add more content here -->
         <p>  Coding is very interesting and provides the ability to create some extrodinary items; but this could be very challanging at times. Despite some of the frustation that may arise, there are ways to combat this.  Working on small projects could help you become more familure with the coding concepts and hopfully some of findings could help you on your programming journey. This is also in no paticular order</p>

         <h2>Converting an existing file into a new programming language   </h2>
         <p> The first programming lanuage I was taught was Scala. This felt like a good stepping stone to introduce my freshmen class into the world of programming, and I understand why my professors chose this programming lanuage. The following semester, my professors taught us java and the differences between Java and Scala. Our first batch of assignments were to convert our scala projects into Java and this same principle could be applied to other languages.
            For example, if you know how to program in one language you could use that knowledge to grasp another programming langauge  </p>

            <h2> Create a simple calculator </h2>

            <h2> create a text input file</h2>
            <p> Creating an input text file is a good way to learn some of the basic of programming in a language. "Hello world" is one of the first programs that my professors taught their students and this involves a print statement providing the sentence "Hello World". You could add onto this by allowing the program to read user inputs, for example you could require a key be pressed to present the statement. Learning how to do this, especially in a  programming languge you are unfamiliar with, is a good way to graps some of the concepts  </p>
